## 🧠 Framework: Sell Like Crazy Methodology

Every landing page follows this proven psychological sequence:

1. **Pattern Interrupt** — Bold headline that stops the scroll
2. **Call Out the Dream Buyer** — "This is for YOU" identification
3. **Agitate the Problem** — Twist the knife on pain points
4. **Solution Reveal** — Present the product as the answer
5. **Authority & Social Proof** — Testimonials, press, results
6. **The Godfather Offer** — An offer so good they can't refuse
7. **Risk Reversal** — Money-back guarantee, free trial
8. **Urgency & Scarcity** — Time or quantity limited
9. **FAQ / Objection Handling** — Eliminate final doubts
10. **Final CTA** — Clear, compelling call to action

## 🎨 Design Principles
